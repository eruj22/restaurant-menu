# Restaurant Menu

## General Info

This is a simple web app that fetches data for restaurant menu from API <a href="https://documenu.com/" target="_blank">https://documenu.com/</a> and displays it. When you click on different items it shows more information about it in modal. The purpose of the app is just to practice coding in React.

## Demo

Here is a working live demo:

## Technologies used

- React
- React Icons
- SASS

## Possible improvements

One thing that would be my first upgrade is to add relevant pictures of food to the modal. Right now in the API response there is no added pictures.
